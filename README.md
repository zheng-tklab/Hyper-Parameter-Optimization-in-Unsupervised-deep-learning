# Hyper-Parameter-Optimization-in-Unsupervised-deep-learning
Currently three algorithms are implemented in hyperopt:

Random Search
Tree of Parzen Estimators (TPE)
Adaptive TPE
Hyperopt has been designed to accommodate Bayesian optimization algorithms based on Gaussian processes and regression trees, but these are not currently implemented.

All algorithms can be parallelized in two ways, using:
